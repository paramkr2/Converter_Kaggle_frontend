# Kaggle Video Converter

This application converts videos pointed to by any URL to HEVC format. 
It utilizes the Kaggle API to perform the task. 
To use this application, you need to generate an API token from Kaggle with internet access enabled. 
Unlike using Kaggle through the interface, here you can create more than two running tasks at a time.
